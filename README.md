### What is Credit Risk Analysis

Credit risk analysis is a method of determining the likelihood that a customer will fail to make a payment before any credit is extended to them. To assess a customer's creditworthiness, businesses establish their history of timely payment and their ability to continue doing so. High risk customers are inversely proportional to cashflow since even if a small proportion of these customers default/lag their payment, it will directly hit the cashflow of the firm. Credit risk analysis is not a new concept but it's amalgamation with Machine Learning/Statitics has been upcoming and valued after a few successful deployment of these models. But these model require more things than just the payment history, they require almost all details linked to the customer.

### Defining Clean Data
Here I am trying to clean the data which is required for credit risk analysis. The definition of clean data is relative and varies depending on it's usage. For me, I am defining a clean data as a data which can be used for predicting the probability of the customers and a data which is machine readable. But I will also be providing with a clean data which was defined according to a paper written by Wickham (which is human readable data)
